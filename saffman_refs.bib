@misc{poldress2017,
note={Calculations for $m_J=1/2$ with the field along the quantization axis used a basis size of 1170 thus requiring diagonalization of $1170\times 1170$ matrices.
The large basis size arises from including seven Fourier components and all states differing from the initial state by $\delta n^*\le 3.5$ and with $L\le 5$.
For cases with the field not along the quantization axis there is coupling to other $m_J$ values which required a basis size of 5851 states.
Computation time on the HTCondor cluster at University of Wisconsin-Madison was 3(24) hours for a single case of field parallel(not parallel) with
 the quantization axis.  
Computations  with 100 parameter values were executed in parallel using 100 nodes of the cluster, with each node having 20 computational cores.
For the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction calculation of Fig. 9 the matrix size depended on where the cutoff for the energy spacing was, and typically 
required $\sim 5000$ states. Run times were 12-24 hours for a single set of parameters.

We observe the onset of condensation for 1\.{}104 atoms at a temperature of 100 nK. This result opens the way for studies of atom losses and decoherence in a BEC interacting with a superconducting surface. Studies of dipole-blockade with long-lived Rydberg atoms in a small and dense atomic sample are underway.}
